// A keyed layer's motion path, as the engine samples it (docs/07 §2.4).
//
// In plain terms: once a layer's Position is animated, the line it travels
// along is worth seeing on the picture, with a dot at every key. The engine
// samples that line once per frame across the keyed range, so what is drawn is
// the curve the render follows and not a second guess at it.
//
// **Why this is a cache and not a call in the paint path.** The Viewer rebuilds
// on every movement of the pointer, and a bridge call per rebuild is what the
// rebuild budget exists to stop. A path changes only when the document does,
// and is drawn only for the outlined layers, so it is asked for once per
// outlined layer per document revision and held.
